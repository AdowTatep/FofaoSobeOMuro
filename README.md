# FofaoSobeOMuro
My first game. Made with unity near beginning of 2015

## Play it here: https://adowtatep.github.io/FofaoSobeOMuro/

> Unfortunately chrome doesn't support unity plugin anymore, so it just works with firefox 

Maybe one day I'll get back to the project and finish it so maybe a WebGL version to run on chrome :)

Climb in the wall! Control Fofão to climb on the wall and don't hit the obstacles and let him fall! How far can you go? :D

## How to play:

 - Up and down arrow keys
 - If the green barr is filled you can climb in the wall to avoid the obstacles!(Press up when near the wall)
 - Press space repeatedly to fill your fofonice's bar!
 - If your fofonice's bar reach 0 you'll fall from the wall
 - If you stay long enough in the wall holding the fofonice's bar in the max, you'll restart your speed helping you get further!

The game AND the site are not finished at all

Unfortunately when changing hds and formatting the pc I lost the game's files. So I couldn't continue its development. I recovered most of these files but they lost their bound inside the engine. And I didn't continued to work on it to get everything together again :/

About

Fofão sobe o muro is a game I worked on to learn Unity and gaming programming in general, I learned a lot with it. I made it knowing NOTHING at all and I did that to challenge myself and prove that I can do what I want when I want it, without actually knowing how. With a friend's help that painted most of the sprites we could make this real and we had a looot of fun doing it.
